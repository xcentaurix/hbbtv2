# WPE HbbTV test plugin (HbbTV 2.0 experiment)
#
# Shows a WPE WebKit page on top of enigma2 (via the external wpe_fb process) and gives it the remote control:
#
#   - a full-screen, borderless, transparent Screen is opened. As the top screen it is the only one whose
#     actions run, so the remote keys go to it and not to the infobar / channel list underneath;
#   - every key is forwarded to wpe_fb through a FIFO (/tmp/wpe_fb.ctl) as "key <name>" and arrives in the page as
#     a normal DOM keydown event;
#   - EXIT closes the app: "quit" is sent, wpe_fb releases the screen, then enigma2 is told to repaint everything
#     (getDesktop(0).paint()) so nothing of the overlay is left behind.
#
# wpe_fb itself keeps the overlay on top of enigma2's redraws (page flips) - see wpe_fb.c "guard" mode.
#
# Files it expects next to this plugin (installed with it):
#   run_wpe.sh   starts wpe_fb with the right environment
#   pages/*.html the pages offered in the chooser
